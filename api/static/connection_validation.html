<span style='color:black'>
Expected input is JSON with a "points" list containing one or more tasks.
Valid input for this protocol will create a project (if needed) and an assignment containing all tasks in the "points" list:
<pre>
{
  <span style='color:#ccc'>"note": "Project note",
  "group": "Project group",
  "source": "Neu3',
  "user": "neacee",</span>
  "body_id": 1043825714,
  "points": [
    [
      25104,
      23463,
      19106
    ],
    [
      29994,
      21314,
      22659
    ]
  ]
}
</pre>
Elements in <span style='color:#ccc'>gray</span> are optional, all others are required. Any additional data not shown above is ignored.
If a user is specified, the assignment is assigned to them; otherwise, it's assigned to the caller.
</span>
